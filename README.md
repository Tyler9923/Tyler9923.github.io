*About Me 

**My interests 
Some hobbies of mine include Music and Cars. In my free time I collect vinyl's of all different types and play them on my record player. I also a few months ago started learning how to DJ in hopes to add that to my list of hobbies. In regards to cars I grew up around car lovers so I myself have a few cars I like to work on to make them looks better and feel better. Academically I love anything IT related I learn something new everyday which I think is super cool. 

**Websites I recommend 

Cisco DNA Center
This site is a site I use for work. I think it's cool because we use this to locate and manage our many different network devices such as switches and access points across our companies network.

Twitch
This site is cool because you are able to watch people stream all types of content from gaming to people who are just chatting and everything in between.
